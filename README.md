This repo holds my resume. If you just want to read the resume it's here:
https://github.com/albertniemoller/resume/blob/main/src/AlbertNiemollerResume.md

Some of my contact info is purposefully
redacted in this public repo. Please contact me through GitHub if you wish to
inquire about employing me. 

This markdown resume and repo was heavily influenced by https://mszep.github.io/pandoc_resume/ and https://learnbyexample.github.io/customizing-pandoc/

Creating a pdf version of the resume is automated via the Makefile. Simply
```make all``` to generate pretty versions. It will fail if you don't have latex
and pandoc installed and if you haven't created a redactsnippets/contactinfo.md
for the contact info that I'm redacting here. My contact info is formatted as a
table, do what you like with yours.

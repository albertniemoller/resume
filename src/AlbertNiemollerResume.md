## Summary and Objective

I have over 20 years of experience in software development and have been
successful in diverse environments ranging from embedded systems to web frontend
development. I've been at Amazon for 17 of those years during which time I was
promoted from entry level to principal engineer. In the past decade I have
delivered distributed systems that have often had very high availability
constraints and/or worked with big data. 

I am interested in positions where I can have a direct and substantive 
impact on the major problems facing people and societies.

## Experience

**2013-present AWS Security** *Principal Software Development Engineer*

As a Principal Engineer I influence decisions about what systems are built and
how they are built at the director level. This involves both deep detail
oriented work on a handful of projects as well as a broader advisory role in
which I consult with many projects and teams. Most of my delivery has been 
services for the use of non-security Amazon teams. These services help those 
teams continually improve the security posture of their own services. By nature,
some of these services are in the critical path for AWS operations and therefore
have very high availability constraints that inform design choices. Specific
achievements:

+ Architected and guided development of a new internal security data platform
and communications portal for security issue remediation through implementation.
+ Major contributor to the implementation of an initiative to raise the bar for
access to internal data. Designed major cross-application implementation
concepts and guided the development of multiple tools including an operational
tools platform and a plug-in authorization framework for web applications.  
Service catalog
+ Implemented the first system capable of continuously monitoring the very large
volume AWS network logs for indicators of compromise. 
+ Designed and built a web application that allows internal server owners to
search and browse select system calls on their hosts. This system needed to
scale to allow searching these data across many millions of servers. This was
built independently and then handed off to a dedicated team once it had
demonstrated its value. 

**2009-2013 AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** *Senior Software Development Engineer*

Member of an engineering team maintaining foundational EC2 infrastructure
services backing the external EC2 product.  Proposed, designed and implemented
improvements to server inventory management, provisioning reliability, and
network address management.  Built automation for managing login credentials
across EC2 network hosts. 

ruby, java, bash, AWS, dns, dhcp, linux

**2006-2009 Amazon.com** *Software Development Engineer*

Member of an engineering team developing and maintaining web applications for
use by Amazon.com affiliates and their customers. Built and maintained features
across frontend and backend layers. Introduced unit testing and improved code
practices to team. Built tools to reduce friction in the code release process. 

perl 5, C++, XSLT, ruby, javascript.

**2002-2006 Navy Surface Warfare Center** *Scientist*

Member of a team maintaining embedded computer systems deployed to U.S. Navy
ships. Implemented low level Navy communication protocols in C for use in an
integration test simulation platform. Designed an effort to port an on-ship
software system onto commercial open standards. This involved porting it from
VxWorks onto LynxOS, modifying device driver code for the new environment, and
at the same time refactoring it into independent modules that communicated using
a pub/sub middleware. Took this project through proof of concept and demo. 

 C/C++, Ada, perl, LynxOS, VxWare. 

**2000-2001 J&M Corporation of Virginia** *Programmer*

Developed database driven web applications for corporate intranets and electronic 
commerce websites. Worked from customer requirements, designed database schemas,
and implemented frontends using MS Active Server Pages. Worked directly with
customers to debug issues and make desired modifications.

website in style and organization and implemented new functionality such as a web 
interface to commonly used reference CDs. Developed a database of common
bugfixes for the company's products using their bug tracking software package. These 
accomplishments were both noted in the corporate newsletter at the end of the
summer. Javascript, HTML.
